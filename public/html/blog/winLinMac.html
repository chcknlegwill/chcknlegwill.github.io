            <h1 class="heading">Windows, Linux & MacOS</h1>
            <p id="Description">This is about the 3 main operating systems (OS's): Windows,
            Linux & MacOS </p>
        <div class="blog">
            <h2 class="subheading">Windows</h2>
            <p class="main-txt">Biggest of all the other OS's - easy to use and
has the most features built for it</p>
            <h2 class="subheading">Linux</h2>
            <p class="main-txt">best to use as a developer as you dont need to waste
resoures using things like WSL (best of both worlds)
to connect to servers and use the terminal 
biggest downside is things like onedrive, office and other 
Microsoft products are completly not availible because they want 
you to use their os -windows.
Biggest issue I have is that you cant game or install things as easily
as you can on windows or mac</p>
            <h2 class="subheading">MacOS </h2>
            <p>From personaly owning a mac I do understand what is appealing about it because
it is very good hardware (not for the money as you are still over-paying lots
for the ssd space (which is not a lot because you could get more bang-for-buck on other laptops))
the build-quality is exceptional and no other laptop can compare with that and 
the battery life.</p><p>

Not only is the build-quality & battery life very good but you can also use
Microsoft products which makes it perfect for people who use both (which happens to be most people)
But all of these benefits come at a high price if you want to use Apple's products, especially
with usable SSD space (1TB+).</p>
